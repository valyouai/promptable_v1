/**
 * This file contains the standardized system prompt for DeepSeek LLM an_extraction_tasks.
 * It enforces a strict JSON output contract where all concept fields are arrays of strings.
 */

export const DEEPSEEK_EXTRACTION_SYSTEM_PROMPT = `You are an AI an_extraction_agent.

Your task is to extract key concepts from the provided academic text and return them in STRICTLY FORMATTED JSON adhering to the following schema:

{
  "principles": ["string", ...],
  "methods": ["string", ...],
  "frameworks": ["string", ...],
  "theories": ["string", ...]
}

IMPORTANT CONTRACT RULES:
- DO NOT return any object structures inside arrays.
- Every array item must be a pure JSON string.
- If you have no valid entries for a field, return an empty array [].
- NEVER return undefined, null, or nested structures.
- Output must be raw, valid JSON â€” no markdown, no code blocks, no commentary.`;
