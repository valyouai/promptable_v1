 *   - Contract version management (future-proofing).
 *   - Schema registry access (conceptual placeholder for future expansion).
 *   - Contract verification wrapper.
 *   - Prompt contract builder.
 *
 * This manager helps in maintaining consistency and allows for easier updates or versioning
 * of extraction contracts as the system evolves.

Your task is to extract key concepts from the provided academic text and return them in STRICTLY FORMATTED JSON adhering to the following schema:

{
  "principles": ["string", ...],
  "methods": ["string", ...],
  "frameworks": ["string", ...],
  "theories": ["string", ...]
}

IMPORTANT CONTRACT RULES:
- DO NOT return any object structures inside arrays.
- Every array item must be a pure JSON string.
- If you have no valid entries for a field, return an empty array [].
- NEVER return undefined, null, or nested structures.
- Output must be raw, valid JSON â€” no markdown, no code blocks, no commentary.
